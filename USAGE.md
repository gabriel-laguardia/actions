This is a dummy JavaScript action that waits a given number of milliseconds:

```yaml
uses: actions/javascript-action@v1
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

The purpose of this repository is to provide a template to bootstrap the creation of a JavaScript action :rocket:.

The template includes tests, linting, a validation workflow, publishing, and versioning guidance. See [default](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action) branch.
